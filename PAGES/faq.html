    <p>Ever since Skynet caused a nuclear fallout in Terminator, a lot of people have viewed technology as the enemy. Maybe it wouldn’t end the world, but it will certainly be the end of their businesses. But, were they right? Well, the short answer is no. However, it can get a little more complicated if you really dig into it.

        Some industries tend to be a bit more stubborn than others, and the moving industry would certainly fall into that category. But that understandable, for thousands of years, moving hasn’t changed much. However, over the last decade, more and more customers are demanding easier, faster, and more convenient moves. Small, app-based startups are beginning to creep into the industry and the question that needs to be answered is, where is the moving industry heading?
        
        The answer is that the consumers drive the market where they want it to go, which is almost always in a more convenient direction. And while it’s difficult to build, and sometimes painful to implement, technology is designed to make the end user's life easier. 
        
        While there are hundreds of ways that technology can help your business, we have whittled it down to the top 7 kinds of technology that can jump-start your moving company and help you keep pace with the evolving industry.
        
        1. A CRM system
        Imagine how fast your company could grow if you converted twice as many leads as you currently do. Well, with a moving company CRM, that reality is closer than you think.
    
        When all of your customer information is easily navigable, the entire organization runs more smoothly. There is no such thing as a missing folder when you have a CRM system. A good CRM is a collection of tools that improve the efficiency of your business, like eSignatures, document generators, lead management tools, virtual surveying, and more. Basically, A CRM helps your company communicate more effectively, organize information, and target customers more effectively.</p>
